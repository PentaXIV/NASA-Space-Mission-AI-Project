## Chosen Track: Implementation 
## Description: 
Build an AI to predict radiation exposure levels for astronauts based on numerical data from space weather (e.g., solar activity, cosmic ray flux).
## Data: 
Use NASAâ€™s simulated radiation measurements.
## AI Approach: 
1. Use Neural Network
2. Use regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost) to predict radiation levels from input variables like solar flare intensity.
## Output: 
Numerical radiation dose predictions and safety thresholds.
## How to run the code:
The code is segmented conceptually. 
The code should be run line by line
